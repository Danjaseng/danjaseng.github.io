    <p>
        Rainfeeders are relatively small yet highly adaptable creatures commonly found in areas with high precipitation.
        They are docile and avoid confrontation with other creatures.
        They are characterized by a beak on the top of their heads. During rainfall, the beak opens to feed upon
        the water.
    </p>
    <p>
        Rainfeeders have a specialized flagella used for traversal over ground.
        The flagella functions as a sort of spring or pogo stick that allows them to move in a bouncing motion.
        Rainfeeders also have a single eye, giving the ability to see. 
        It has clear vision but lacks the depth perception that multiple-eyed creatures posess.
        They use their eyesight to find suitable nesting grounds (often under trees) or to locate hostile predators.
        After spotting a predator, rainfeeders will desperately attempt to hop away. 
        However, they lack any defensive capability after being caught, at best resorting to a helpless flail.

        Rainfeeders have a multitude of activities to pass the time:

    <ul>
        <li>Hopping</li>
        <li>Looking at things</li>
        <li>Feeding on rain</li>
        <li>Listening to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SZkR3PyHTs0">music</a></li>
        <li>And other things too!</li>
